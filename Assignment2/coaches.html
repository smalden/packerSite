        <h2>Head Coach: Matt LaFleur</h2>
        <p>In his first three seasons leading the Packers, LaFleur has authored one of the greatest starts to a head-coaching career in NFL history. With a 13-4 record in 2021, he led the Packers to a third straight NFC North crown while also earning the No. 1 seed in the NFC for the second consecutive season. LaFleur became the first coach in NFL history to post 13-plus wins in three straight seasons and his 39 wins from 2019-21 passed George Seifert (38) for the most wins by an NFL head coach in his first three seasons in the league (Elias Sports Bureau). LaFleur's 39 wins are also tied for the second most by a coach over any three-season span in league history, trailing only Mike Ditka's 40 wins with the Chicago Bears from 1985-87 (Elias).

            <br><br>Green Bay's success under LaFleur has been highlighted by its domination of the NFC North and success at Lambeau Field. While capturing three division titles, he has gone 15-3 against NFC North opponents, an .833 winning percentage that ranks as the best in the history of the NFC North/Central (min. 10 games, Elias). Green Bay finished the 2021 campaign with an 8-0 record at home, the only NFL team to be undefeated at home last season, and it marked the third straight season the Packers have won seven-plus home games, tied for the second-longest streak in team history (2010-12) behind only a five-season stretch from 1994-98. Most impressively, Green Bay has won 13 straight regular-season home games under LaFleur, the longest active streak in the NFL and tied for the fourth-longest home winning streak in team history. Overall, LaFleur has guided the Packers to a 22-2 record (.917) in the regular season at Lambeau Field, the top home mark in the NFL from 2019-21 and the best home winning percentage by a Packers head coach in his first three seasons. His 22 wins at home are also the most in NFL history by a coach in his first three seasons.
            
            <br><br>The Packers' offense continued to excel under LaFleur in 2021, finishing the season ranked No. 10 in the NFL in total offense (365.6 ypg) and total points (450). The offense was led by spectacular individual seasons from QB Aaron Rodgers and WR Davante Adams. For the second consecutive season under LaFleur, and the fourth time overall, Rodgers was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player by The Associated Press and the Pro Football Writers of America. He led the league with a passer rating of 111.9, joining Steve Young (six times), Roger Staubach (four) and Ken Anderson (four) as the only players to lead the league in passer rating at least four times since 1970. Adams set new single-season team records for receptions (123) and receiving yards (1,553) last season as he became the first player in team history with three 100-catch seasons (2018, 2020-21). He also became the first player in league history to post 115-plus catches, 1,350-plus receiving yards and 11-plus receiving TDs in back-to-back seasons (2020-21).

        <h2>Offensive Coordinator: Adam Stenavich</h2>
        <div class="coachright"><img src="images/adamStenavich.jpg" alt="Coach Adam Stenavich"></div>
        <p>
            <br><br>Entering his sixth season as a coach in the NFL, Adam Stenavich begins his fourth year coaching with the Packers and his first season as offensive coordinator after being promoted on Jan. 31, 2022.

            <br><br>Stenavich (STEN-uh-vitch) originally joined the team as offensive line coach on Jan. 24, 2019, and then was promoted to offensive line/run game coordinator by Head Coach Matt LaFleur on March 1, 2021. Stenavich came to Green Bay after spending two seasons as the assistant offensive line coach for the San Francisco 49ers (2017-2018). Prior to that, he spent six years in the college ranks, including stints as the offensive line coach at San Jose State (2015-16) and Northern Arizona (2014). Stenavich began his coaching career at his alma mater, the University of Michigan, as a strength and conditioning intern in 2011 before serving as a graduate assistant for the Wolverines for two seasons (2012-13).

            <br><br>Despite being without five-time All-Pro T David Bakhtiari (knee) for all but one game in 2021, Stenavich's line helped Green Bay rank in the top 10 in the league in passing offense (No. 8, 253.8 ypg), total offense (No. 10, 365.6 ypg), scoring offense (No. 10, 26,5 ppg), giveaways (t-No. 1, 13) and time of possession (No. 1, 32:43). The Packers allowed one or fewer sacks in seven games on the season, tied for No. 8 in the NFL, despite using seven different starting combinations on the line due to injuries. The line protected QB Aaron Rodgers as he threw 38 TD passes with just four INTs for a league-leading 111.9 passer rating on his way to being named the NFL's Most Valuable Player by The Associated Press for the second straight season.

            <br><br>In 2020, Stenavich coached a line that helped the Packers rank No. 1 in the NFL in scoring (31.9 ppg), giveaways (team-record 11) and time of possession (32:29), tied for No. 2 in sacks allowed (21), No. 5 in total offense (389.0 ypg) and No. 3 in yards per play (6.29). Green Bay allowed one sack/zero sacks in a league-high 13 games in 2020, tied for the most in a season in team history (2004), as Rodgers threw a franchise-record 48 TD passes and just five INTs for a 121.5 passer rating. The line helped pave the way for RB Aaron Jones to set a single-season franchise mark for yards per carry (league-best 5.49) among players with 200-plus attempts, surpassing FB Jim Taylor's mark of 5.42 yards per carry in 1962. Bakhtiari and C Corey Linsley each earned first-team AP All-Pro honors, while Bakhtiari and G/T Elgton Jenkins were both named to the Pro Bowl roster. Bakhtiari received All-Pro recognition for the fifth consecutive season, while his Pro Bowl selection marked the third of his career. Jenkins became just the third Packers offensive lineman (Deral Teteak, 1952; Charley Brock, 1940) to make the Pro Bowl within his first two seasons
