        <h1>Welcome To The Home of The Green Bay Packers!</h1>
        <p>The Green Bay Packers have debatebly the most storied franchise in NFL history. With a record 13 League Championship wins, with 4 being in the superbowl era, the Packers have more than any other team in the league.
            The team is also well known for its loyal fanbase, who through public offerings of team stock are able to own a share of the team. The team has a historic rivalry against the Chicago Bears, whom they have played in over 200 games.
            The Packers also share a fierce rivalry with the Detroit Lions, who have been rivals since the 1930s, and the Minnesota Vikings who also reside in the NFC North.
        </p>
        <h2>Fanbase</h2>
        <p>The Packers have an exceptionally loyal fan base. Regardless of team performance, every game played in Green Bay preseason, regular season, and playoffs has been sold out since 1960.
            Despite the Packers having by far the smallest local TV market, the team consistently ranks as one of the most popular in the NFL.
            Packers fans are often referred to as cheeseheads, a nickname for Wisconsin residents reflecting the state's bountiful cheese production first leveled as an insult at a 1987 game between the Chicago White Sox and Milwaukee Brewers.
            Instead, it came to be a statewide source of pride, and particularly since 1994 has been embraced by Packers fans. Bright orange triangular cheesehead hats are a fixture wherever the team plays.
        </p>
        <h2>Public Ownership</h2>
        <p>The Packers are the only community-owned franchise in North America's four traditional major leagues. Rather than being the property of an individual, partnership, or corporate entity, they are held by stockholders, 
            more than 537,000 in total as of 2022. No one is allowed to hold more than 200,000 shares. It is this broad-based community support and non-profit structure which has kept the team in Green Bay for nearly a century even though it is 
            the smallest market in North American professional sports. As of 2021, there have been six stock sales to fund Packer operations over the team's history, beginning with $5,000 being raised through 1,000 shares offered at $5 apiece in 1923.
            The latest was in November 2021, where they sold almost 200,000 shares.</p>
